%description
This package contains a ROS wrapper for OpenSlam's Gmapping. The gmapping
package provides laser-based SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping), as a
ROS node called slam_gmapping. Using slam_gmapping, you can create a 2-D
occupancy grid map (like a building floorplan) from laser and pose data
collected by a mobile robot.

# in the install tree that was dropped by catkin, and source it.  It will
# set things like CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH, PKG_CONFIG_PATH, and PYTHONPATH.
